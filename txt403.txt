and then i saw her.her feet dangling off the bench,her legs swaying back and forth,her hands leaning on the edges,her head facing up the sky,and her voice,her voice is singing through the night.i have never experienced the night that way before.and i wanted it to go on forever.why can i identify with this?because both of you are too in love to think.is it bad?i don't know. i haven't been in love.but i have been hurt so please,stop this.we're close.
