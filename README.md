# Life Is Stranger

**Legacy Project**

A basic interactive story written for x86 TASM with the following instructions:
- find traces and conversations to find Luna
- arrow keys to drive the character
- left click to interact with traces
- enter to interact with conversations
- escape to go back

# Build
It was built using TASM in DOSBox, thus it must be built and executed within it.
```
tasm /m2 life
tlink life
```

It can be played by
`life`

# Note
TASM is included in this repository but DOSBox isn't. DOSBox is an x86 emulator and can be downloaded from [here](https://www.dosbox.com/download.php?main=1).
